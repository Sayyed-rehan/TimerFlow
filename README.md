Setup Instructions
------------------

To begin using the application, follow these steps:

1.  **Homepage Setup**:
    
    *   On the homepage, you will find three text fields:
        
        *   **Title**: Enter the title for the timer (e.g., "Workout", "Study Session").
            
        *   **Duration**: Provide the timer duration in seconds.
            
        *   **Category**: Specify the category for the timer (e.g., "Exercise", "Break", "Study").
            
    *   Click on the **'Add Timer'** button.
        
2.  **Starting the Timer**:
    
    *   Once the **'Add Timer'** button is clicked, the timer for the entered duration will start.
        
    *   The title of the timer and its associated category will be displayed.
        
3.  **Pause, Resume, and Reset Timer**:
    
    *   **Pause Timer**: You can pause the timer at any point using the Pause button.
        
    *   **Resume Timer**: Use the Resume button to continue the timer from where it was paused.
        
    *   **Reset Timer**: If you want to stop the current timer and reset it back to its original duration, use the Reset button.

    *   **Circular Progress Bar**: The timer's progression is visualized dynamically via a circular progress bar, giving a clear indication of the remaining time.
        
4.  **Timer Completion**:
    
    *   When the timer completes, a notification will alert the user that the timer has exceeded its assigned time with the Title.
        
5.  **History Logs**:
    
    *   After the notification, the completed timer and its details will be added to the history log for reference.
    *   To view the logs of all completed timers, click on the "Go Timer Log" button, which will display the previous timer sessions along with their details (title, duration, and category).
