Setup Instructions
------------------

To begin using the application, follow these steps:

1.  **Homepage Setup**:
    
    *   On the homepage, you will find three text fields:
        
        *   **Title**: Enter the title for the timer (e.g., "Workout", "Study Session").
            
        *   **Duration**: Provide the timer duration in seconds.
            
        *   **Category**: Specify the category for the timer (e.g., "Exercise", "Break", "Study").
            
    *   Click on the **'Add Timer'** button.
        
2.  **Starting the Timer**:
    
    *   Once the **'Add Timer'** button is clicked, the timer for the entered duration will start.
        
    *   The title of the timer and its associated category will be displayed.
        
3.  **Pause, Resume, and Reset Timer**:
    
    *   **Pause Timer**: You can pause the timer at any point using the Pause button.
        
    *   **Resume Timer**: Use the Resume button to continue the timer from where it was paused.
        
    *   **Reset Timer**: If you want to stop the current timer and reset it back to its original duration, use the Reset button.

    *   **Circular Progress Bar**: The timer's progression is visualized dynamically via a circular progress bar, giving a clear indication of the remaining time.
        
4.  **Timer Completion**:
    
    *   When the timer completes, a notification will alert the user that the timer has exceeded its assigned time with the Title.
        
5.  **History Logs**:
    
    *   After the notification, the completed timer and its details will be added to the history log for reference.
    *   To view the logs of all completed timers, click on the "Go Timer Log" button, which will display the previous timer sessions along with their details (title, duration, and category).

Development Assumptions
-----------------------

The project was built with a focus on creating an **interactive and visually appealing experience**. Key assumptions included:

*   **Advanced Timer Controls**: Features like pause, resume, and reset ensure seamless user interaction.
    
*   **Visual Progress Tracking**: A circular progress path enhances usability and keeps users engaged.
    
*   **Alerts for Completion**: Timely notifications capture attention when a timer ends.
    
*   **Task Categorization**: Organizing tasks into **Exercise**, **Study**, and **Workout** adds clarity and aesthetic value to the interface.
    

These thoughtful design choices reflect an emphasis on functionality and user-centric design.
